# Teen Patti - React Native Starter

Simple **Teen Patti** (3-card poker) starter app built with React Native.

## Features
- 3 players (You + 2 AI)
- Deal 3 cards each
- Simple betting rounds (fixed bet)
- Fold / Show actions
- Works with React 16 / React Native environments (hooks used; React >=16.8 recommended)

## Run (native RN)
1. `npm install`
2. For Android: `npx react-native run-android`
3. For iOS: `npx react-native run-ios` (macOS)

If your environment is very old, ensure React >=16.8 (hooks support). The code avoids native modules and external deps.
